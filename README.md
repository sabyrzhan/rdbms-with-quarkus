# RDBMS with Quarkus
This is the project from [Accessing relational database with Quarkus](https://www.udemy.com/course/quarkus-accessing-relational-databases-with-quarkus/) 
course from Udemy that I used to learn:
- accessing database using pure JDBC
- accessing database using Panache Repositories and ActiveRecord
- accessing database using JPA API

This course does not cover anything related to reactive development but only accesses using JDBC driver.
